# DTO classes (Data Transfer Object)

Private properties with type hints
Static factory method (fromArray)
Conversion methods (toArray, toDbArray)
Getters and setters with type hints
Validation method
Strong data sanitization
Proper integration with WordPress functions
Consistent use of LUS_Constants
Metadata handling
File path/URL handling (for recordings)

These DTOs will help ensure type safety and data consistency throughout the application.

The Duration value object includes:
Immutable value object pattern
Multiple factory methods for different input types
Validation and error handling
Arithmetic operations (add/subtract)
Comparison methods
Multiple formatting options
WordPress localization support
Type safety through type hints
Full documentation
Consistent error messages

This can be used throughout the application for handling durations in recordings, time limits, etc. It ensures consistent duration handling and formatting.

# The LUS_Status class now includes:

Status validation
State transitions with rules
Status checks and comparisons
Labels and descriptions
Formatting methods
Type safety through type hints
Proper exception handling
Integration with WordPress localization
Value object immutability

These three value objects (Score, DifficultyLevel, Status) work together to provide:
Type-safe handling of domain values
Validation and error handling
Immutable value objects
Clear business rules
Consistent formatting

The evaluation strategy implementation includes:
Interface defining evaluation contract
Levenshtein implementation with:

## Text normalization

Multiple scoring components (length, case, exact match, Levenshtein)
Weighted scoring system
Confidence calculation
Detailed evaluation results
Performance limits
Unicode support via mb\_\* functions
WordPress localization
Configurable parameters

This provides a robust foundation for text comparison that can be extended with other strategies (e.g., phonetic matching, semantic analysis) by implementing the same interface.

# The updated main plugin file lus.php includes:

Proper plugin header with license information
Class autoloader
Essential constants
Version and dependency checks
Service container initialization
Event system integration
Error handling
Lifecycle management (activation, deactivation)
Cleanup routines
Update checking foundation

## Key improvements:

Better error handling
Event-driven architecture
Service container for dependency management
Organized constants
Automated cleanup of temporary files
Proper WordPress coding standards
Extensible update system
Clear lifecycle management
Better documentation

The file serves as the entry point and bootstrap for all plugin functionality while maintaining good separation of concerns and extensibility.

Cache keys based on query parameters

## Transaction Support

Transaction wrapper methods
Callback-based transaction handling
Proper error handling and rollbacks

## Error Handling

Centralized error handler
Exception throwing
Detailed error messages

## Query Building
